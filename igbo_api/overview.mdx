## Collections

There are three different types of data that can be returned from the API:

- [Words](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/models/Word.ts) are a superset to your standard dictionary word entry.
  They not only include definitions and parts of speech, but also audio recordings, dialectal variations, word frequency, and Igbo definitions.

- [Examples](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/models/Example.ts) are Igbo sentences with language text pairings.
  Each example sentence includes both Igbo and English, alongside other types of metadata like style and conceptual meaning of the Igbo sentence.

- [Nsịbịdị](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/models/NsibidiCharacter.ts) are character documents that represent each [Nsịbịdị](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsibidi) character.
  It includes the character pronunciation, the Chinese Unicode to represent the character using the [Akagu font](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvGQvoGXZA), and more.
