### Step 1: Generate an API Token

Visit [Igbo API](https://igboapi.com/signup) to create an account and generate an API token.

### Step 2: Use API Token as Authorization Header

Each request to the Igbo API needs to have the `Authorization` header filled in with the
API token in the format of:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <API_Token>
```

### Step 3: Refer to API Reference

Visit the API Reference section to learn how to fetch specific words, examples, and Nsịbịdị
