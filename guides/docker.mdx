<Tip>
  This is an alternative approach to locally running the Igbo API. If you want
  to run the Igbo API on your machine, navigate to the
  [Development](/igbo_api/development) section
</Tip>

## Step 1: Install Docker

If you don't have Docker on your machine, you can install it [here](https://docker.com)

## Step 2: Download the Igbo API Docker Image

Download the [Igbo API Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ijemmao/igbo_api_server/general)

## Step 3: Run the Image

Run the following command:

```bash
npm run start:docker
```

<Check>The Igbo API will be running at http://localhost:8080</Check>

<Warning>
  Ensure you are not running the Igbo API with `npm` while running with Docker.
  The ports will clash if both are running concurrently.
</Warning>
