## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

Please follow this [Firebase Getting Started Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to create your own Firebase project.

## Step 2: Replace the `default` Firebase Project Name

Within [.firebaserc](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/.firebaserc), replace the project name `igbo-api-bb22d` and
`igbo-api-staging-99a67` with your new Firebase project name

## Step 3: Replace the Firebase Config file

Within [firebase.js](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/services/firebase.js#L5-L13), replace the
`PRODUCTION_FIREBASE_CONFIG` and `STAGING_FIREBASE_CONFIG` objects with your firebase project config object

## Step 4: Merging forked changes into main repo

Congrats ðŸŽ‰ You have a change you want to merge into the main repo. You will need to complete a few extra steps to ensure your branch builds pass.

3. In the sidebar, click on the "Secrets and variables" dropdown
4. Select "Actions"

7. Paste in the token you received from running `firebase login`
8. Click the green "Add secret" button
