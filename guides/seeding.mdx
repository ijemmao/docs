## Step 1: Build a Dictionary

The following command places the JSON dictionaries in the `build/` directory:

```bash
npm run build:dictionaries
```

<Tip>
  Here's an example JSON dictionary file:
  [ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json)
</Tip>

## Step 2: Populate the MongoDB Database

Now that the data has been parsed, it needs to be used to populate, or seed, the MongoDB database.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then make a `POST` request to the following route:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/populate // POST
```

<Check>
  After about 20 seconds, if you see the `âœ… Seeding successful.` message in
  your terminal, then you have successfully populated your database.
</Check>

## Verify database seeding was successful

Install one of the options on your machine to view the seeded data

**Option 1:** Download MongoDB Compass

```
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
```

**Option 2:** Install MongoDB VSCode extension

```
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mongodb.mongodb-vscode
```

Connect to your local mongodb cluster using this connection:

```
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/igbo_api
```
