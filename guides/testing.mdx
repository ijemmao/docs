## Frontend

Frontend tests focus specifically on the Igbo API homepage using Cypress. First, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch frontend tests, run:

```bash
npm run jest:frontend
```

## Backend

Backend tests use both locally stored MongoDB and JSON data.

In one terminal, star the local database:

```bash
npm run start:database
```

In another terminal, run the backend tests:

```bash
npm run jest:backend
```
