The Igbo language is very different to English when it comes to grammatical labeling. There is quite a few overlap with
the parts of speech used in both languages. However, Igbo includes adds its own word classes that serve to better represent
their grammatical words.

The attempts to best catalog all valid word classes for the Igbo language by following its
own list of [word classes](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/master/src/shared/constants/WordClass.ts).

Currently, the list of supported word classes includes:
